# v1.2.0 - The one that supports touchscreens.

* Touchscreen support (mobile devices only). The touchscreen controller is only 
shown if no physical gamepad is connected to the mobile device.
* Vibrate mobile devices instead of the physical gamepad if 
the touch screen controller is active.
* Fix minor english localization errors.

# v1.1.0 - The one that speaks english.

* English localization. The first time you play this version, the language of the
game will be matched to the one of your system. If your system language is 
not supported, english will be used.
* Noy you can see the current level of day 1 (story mode only) and day 2.
* Now you can use AWSD to move on menus.

# v1.0.0 - The one that started it all.

* Initial release. This version closely resembles the original game, 
but it adds some minor changes to gameplay, UI and art. 
It also restores the original bad guy which was removed because the minigame 
that introduces him didn't make it to the released product.
