# v1.1.0 - The one that speaks english.

* English localization. The first time you play this version, the language of the
game will be matched to the one of your system. If your system language is 
not supported, english will be used.
* Now you can see the current level of day 1 (story mode only) and day 2.

# v1.0.0 - The one that started it all.

but it adds some minor changes to gameplay, UI and art. 
It also restores the original bad guy which was removed because the minigame 
that introduces him didn't make it to the released product.
