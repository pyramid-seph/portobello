# v1.0.0

* Initial release. This version closely resembles the original game, 
but it adds some minor improvements to gameplay, UI and art. Also, 
it restores the original bad guy that was removed because the minigame that 
introduces him didn't make it to the released product Please note that, 
like the game it replicates, it does **NOT** feature any music or sound effects. 
They are coming at a later update, though!
