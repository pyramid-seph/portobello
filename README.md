# Bucho Busca Comida: Edici√≥n Hongo Portobello

This port (made with [Godot](https://godotengine.org)) is a recreation of a J2ME game I developed with some
 good friends for a school project. It is a collection of minigames about Bucho,
 a hungry cat that happens to get powers from food.

This version closely resembles the original game,
 but it adds some minor improvements to gameplay, UI and art. 
Also, it restores the original bad guy that was removed because the minigame 
that introduces him didn't make it to the released product.

Made as an exercise to learn Godot. It started as a Godot 3.4 project and 
 eventually it was migrated to Godot 4.2.
