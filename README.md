# Bucho Busca Comida: The Portobello Mushroom Edition

This is a remake of a J2ME game I developed with some good friends for a school project. 
It is a collection of minigames about Bucho, a hungry cat that happens to get 
powers from food.

Made as an exercise to learn [Godot](https://godotengine.org). It started as a Godot 3.4 project and 
eventually it was migrated to Godot 4.5.1.
