# Bucho Busca Comida: Edición Hongo Portobello

This port (made with [Godot](https://godotengine.org)) is a recreation of a 
J2ME game I developed with some good friends for a school project. 
It is a collection of minigames about Bucho, a hungry cat that happens to get 
powers from food.

Made as an exercise to learn Godot. It started as a Godot 3.4 project and 
eventually it was migrated to Godot 4.3.
